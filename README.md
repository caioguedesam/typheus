# Typheus
Typheus is an in-development 3D rendering engine for real-time applications. This is a personal project, and is being actively developed to study and apply computer graphics techniques.

Typheus is developed in C++17, and uses OpenGL as a graphics API. In the future, the engine will be ported to Vulkan.

Currently the engine supports simple forward rendering of 3D meshes with applied textures.
