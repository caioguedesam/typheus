# Typheus
Typheus is a C++ library for general purpose game/application development.
Currently, it contains:
- 3D rendering (using Vulkan)
- Basic GUI (using ImGui)
- Asset processing (.obj models, glsl shaders, basic image loading)
- Core library with math, input, memory allocation, string, data structures and async programming (WIP)
- Support for profiling (WIP)

Here are some other features planned for the indeterminate future:
- Audio processing
- Other asset formats (.wav files, JSON, GLTF, etc.)
- Networking (?)

Typheus' main purpose is to facilitate my personal projects, so features will be added whenever I need them.
